      "Purpose: To alter the rates of the standard allowance, limited capability for work (LCW) element, and limited capability for work and work-related activity (LCWRA) element of Universal Credit, and income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA IR) (Preamble).",
      "Key Definitions: Important terms include 'standard allowance' (s.1(6)(c)), 'LCWRA element' (s.3(2)(a)), 'LCW element' (s.3(2)(b)), 'pre-2026 claimant' (Sch.1, para 2, 4), and 'severe conditions criteria claimant' (Sch.1, para 2, 6).",
      "Eligibility: Eligibility for specific Universal Credit elements is differentiated for 'pre-2026 claimants', 'severe conditions criteria claimants', and 'terminally ill' claimants regarding the LCWRA element (s.2(1), Sch.1, para 3, 4, 6). A 'severe conditions criteria claimant' is defined by specific, lifelong bodily or mental disablement diagnosed by a healthcare professional (Sch.1, para 6).",
      "Obligations: The Secretary of State (and NI equivalent) must exercise powers to ensure standard allowance rates (s.1(1)) and protected LCWRA amounts (s.4(1)) are increased for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30 according to specified calculations (s.1(2), s.4(2)).",
      "Enforcement: No specific enforcement mechanisms or penalties are detailed within this Act. The Act relies on existing powers in other legislation (e.g., Welfare Reform Act 2012, Social Security Administration Act 1992) for implementation."
